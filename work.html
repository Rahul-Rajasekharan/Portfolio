                            Node.js,Express.js, MongoDB,
                            Handlebars templating engine, and Ajax for dynamic front-end interactions. This website not
                            only allows users to browse through a wide range of products and add them to their cart but
                            also provides convenient payment options. Users have the flexibility to choose between cash
                            on delivery or online payment. For online payments, I have integrated the Razor pay payment
                            gateway, ensuring secure and seamless transactions. This integration enables users to make
                            payments using various methods such as credit/debit cards, net banking, and digital wallets.
                            With the implementation of cash on delivery and Razor pay integration, this shopping cart
                            website offers a comprehensive and user-friendly shopping experience, prioritizing
                            convenience, and security for customers during the checkout process. The integration of
                            MongoDB allows for efficient storage and retrieval of product data, while the use of
                            Handlebars templating engine enables dynamic rendering of product information on the
                            front-end. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in full-stack
                            development, implementing server-side functionalities, and building robust and user-friendly
                            e-commerce solutions.</p>

                            specifically useState and useEffect. This project aims to recreate the user interface and
                            functionality of the popular streaming platform, Netflix. By integrating with the TMDb (The
                            Movie Database) web service, the clone fetches and displays a wide range of movies and TV
                            shows, allowing users to browse for their favourite content. The use of React Hooks enables
                            efficient state management and lifecycle management, ensuring a smooth and responsive user
                            experience. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in building interactive
                            and dynamic web applications using React and integrating with external APIs.</p>

                            Inspired by popular online marketplace platforms like Olx, this clone provides users with a
                            seamless and intuitive buying and selling experience. With dynamic routing and navigation
                            using React Router Dom, users can easily navigate through different pages and categories.
                            The integration of the Context API ensures efficient state management, allowing for

                            this project, I have gained practical experience in developing complex web applications,
